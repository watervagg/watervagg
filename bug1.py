#that glitch is that if you type the wrong password it will say wrong password
#do you want to try again if press enter or something else than yes or no
#It will send you to the main screen
#This will run 1800 times wait 900 seconds
#Who will wait for that much years?
#I even tried to change year to now its 2022 I went to 2052 
# AND EVEN THEN IT DIN"T WORK
