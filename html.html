            <br>So html is not exactly a coding language its an easy way to make
            <br>websites like this. This site was made only by html you dont need
            <br>css javaScript these are good to have but html can do the job pretty easly
            <br>html is really easy!
            <br>Lets get started!
            <br>make an file that ends in .html
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            type html in <> now i can't type it because its not gonna be shown but ok
            <br>after that if you are not already go four spaces out or press Tab one time
            <br>and say head in <> again I can't type sometihng in <>.
            <br>The head is the url and the name of the tab.
            <br>Now type body in <> and type what ever you want
            <br>
            <hr>        
        </font>
        <font color="#FF0000">
        <center>________________________________________WARNING________________________________________</center>
        <hr>
        <center>to go down one line type br in <>
        and to make lines just type hr in <> b in <>for bold text</center>
        </font>

        <font color="#FFA500">
        <br>
        <br>
        So lets make some buttons buttons are really hard to make because
        <br>there is no if in this language thats one of the reasons whay people
        <br>dont call it an language.
        <br>Now back to what I was saying to make a button work lets say
        <br>button in <> you might find that that you have ending to your button with
        <>/button if not type it on every thing you type eccept br(one line down!)
        <br>every thing needs an ending!
        <br>Make an other file and go live!
        <br>And lets say inside the button<> a href="the url of the other link">name<>/a
        <br>and now go live and you will see that the button works!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <hr>
        </hr>
        <center>Lets make some images!</center>
        <br>
        <br>Now its pretty easy lets say img scr="image_please put it on your coding folder to work!" alt="something" in <>
        <br>and it will hopefully work sometime it doesn't
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <center>Lets make the text better with CSS </center>
        <br>Now as I said you dont need to learn CSS to make sites
        <br>But it good to know!
        <br>This is really practical for images!
        <br>
        <br>
<!-- noise--><br>lets say you want it smaller bigger round and more...
        <br>so type style on <> and the type img for img b for bold and more...
        <br>now type {} and inside then you will type width: 1px; for the width to be 1px
        <br>border-radius: 1px; for how round its going to be!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <center><hr><font color="#0000FF">l</font>e<font color="#FF0000">t</font><font color="#FFFF00">s 
        <font color="#FFA500">m</font><font color="#FF00FF">a</font><font color="#0000FF">k
        </font>e</font><font color="#FF0000"> c</font><font color="#000000">o</font><font color="#FFFF00">l</font>o
        <font color="#FFFFFF">r</font><font color="#FF00FF">s</font></center>
        <br>
        <br>
        lets say body BGCOLOR="Color" make sure you do bgcolor in CapsLk
         in <>  <br>or font color=<font color="#FF0000">"#FF0000"</font> in <> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         that was html i hope you make really nice websites and Keep on coding!
